->1)if you are creating a paran constructir,and creating object for zero param constructor or vice versa
note if you write own costrtuctor compiler wont call any default ocnstructor so you have to create obj for the right constructor

->1) Constructor name should be same as class name.
->2) If you don\'t define a constructor for a class, a default parameterless constructor is automatically

    created by the compiler. 

->3) The default constructor calls super() and initializes all instance variables to default value like 0, null.
->4) If we want to call parent class constructor, it must be called in 
   first line of constructor.

->5)instance variable/global variable can be changed/modified inside the constructor


Constructors are not inherited. A subclass does not automatically inherit constructors from its superclass.
However, a subclass constructor can call a superclass constructor using the super keyword.


->2)If the superclass has a parameterized constructor then you  have to define your own constructors in the subclass to call the superconstructor using super,
 
->3)it can be zero param /param constructor from your subclass ,but you must call one of the superclass’s constructors explicitly.
