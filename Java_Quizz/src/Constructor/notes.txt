->if you are creating a paran constructir,and creating object for zero param constructor or vice versa
note if you write own costrtuctor compiler wont call any default ocnstructor so you have to create obj for the right constrctor

->1) Constructor name should be same as class name.
->2) If you don\'t define a constructor for a class, a default parameterless constructor is automatically

    created by the compiler. 

->3) The default constructor calls super() and initializes all instance variables to default value like 0, null.
->4) If we want to call parent class constructor, it must be called in 
   first line of constructor.

->instance variable can be changed/modified inside the constructor
